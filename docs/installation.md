## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This helps manage dependencies and keeps your system organized. You can set up a virtual environment by following these steps:

1. **Install the virtual environment package** if it's not installed:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

2. **Create a new virtual environment**:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment named 'env'
virtualenv albutortion-env
```     


# Activate the virtual environment
```bash
# On Windows
albutortion-env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS and Linux
source albutortion-env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install the required packages**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
